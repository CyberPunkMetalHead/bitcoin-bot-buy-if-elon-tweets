DESCRIPTION

This bot is designed to buy bitcoin every time Elon musk tweets about bitcoin with the following parameters:

The bot will open a buy position on bitcoin every time Elon mentions bitcoin in his tweet
Take profit is set to 10% and stop loss to 5%
The bitcoin bot will not place another trade if there is already an active trade (can be adjusted) 

The bot uses the Tweepy API and a Twitter developer account that you will need access to, as well as a MetaTrader 5 account.
